>Body mass index(BMI) is calculated as follows: bmi = weight in Kg / (height x height) in m2. Write a function which calculates bmi. BMI is used to broadly define different weight groups in adults 20 years old or older.Check if a person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese based the information given below.
    - The same groups apply to both men and women.
    - Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
    - Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
    - Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
    - Obese: BMI is 30 or more

```js
function calculateBMI(weight, height) {
    let bmi = weight / (height * height);
    let message;
    
    if (bmi < 18.5) {
      message = 'Underweight';
    } else if (bmi >= 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9) {
      message = 'Normal weight';
    } else if (bmi >= 25 && bmi <= 29.9) {
      message = 'Overweight';
    } else {
      message = 'Obese';
    }
    
    return `${bmi.toFixed(1)} - ${message}`;
  }

  
  
  console.log(calculateBMI(68, 1.75));
  
  ```
